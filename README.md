# Convergence of Evidence Tool

This project aims to compute the Convergence of Evidence in the framework of the World Atlas of Desertification.

Environment: Anaconda {GDAL, Rasterio, Geotiff, Numpy, Time} . Jupiter Notebook

**Introduction**
In the framework of the World Atlas of Desertification, 14 indicators, called Global Change Issues (GCI), are used to compute the Convergence of Evidence (CoE). Each indicator is a spatial layer with global coverage and can take values 0 or 1. An indicator takes a value of 1 if it is considered a potential issue relevant for land degradation. The thresholds to assign the values can be stratified by land cover class. The coincidence of issues is summarised as the sum of issues.

## Install

The Tool is provided as Jupiter notebook. It depends on the libraries: GDAL, Rasterio, Geotiff, Numpy and Time.
The virtual environmental setup is defined in the conve.yml.


## The process

The Convergence of Evidence is a map showing the occurence of specific processes related to land degradation (which are indicated as global Change Issues - GCIs). 

Where all the processes are identified as being potentially contributing to land degradation, none on its own is really enough to explain it (only in very specific cases). As we can't model the interaction, we 'simply' try to indicate how many of these processes (GCIs) are simultaneously at play and where this happens. The occurrence of such 'accumulation' at any given location indicates a certain stress on the land resources and suggest that potentially this led, or can lead, to land degradation. 

The computation' process includes the following steps:

* Landcover definition 
* Stratification 
* No Stratification 
* Convergence of Evidence 
* Statistics
